## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This challenge introduced me how to use Fetch with async/await and I also learned how to use the prefer's color scheme, which I found fun.

### Continued development

I really need to focus on how to write cleaner jS. VueJS in particular is very easy to get started and there is tons of information online on how to write simple applications.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is always open and it's really easy to learn how other people approach code.
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - For this project I constantly went back to learn all the ins and out of Vue.

## Acknowledgments

I'd really like to thank [Coding Public](https://github.com/coding-in-public) for putting out a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO3RF_67re8&t=960s) on how to put together the light-dark functionality I used on this site. Great resource.
